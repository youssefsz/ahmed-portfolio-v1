                <p>This Cookie Policy explains how CTF Compass ("we", "our", or "us") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website and mobile application (collectively, the "Service"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
                
                <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
                
                <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, CTF Compass) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
                <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Service to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Service. Third parties serve cookies through our Service for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.</p>
                
                <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

                <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Service and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.

If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Service though your access to some functionality and areas of our Service may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p>
                
                <p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising.

                <h2>5. Do Not Track</h2>
                <p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we do not currently respond to such signals.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
